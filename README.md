# News app

This project was create using the New York Times API to fetch and display various news articles.

Application also got some nice features like search to search for particular article, categories to display articles by category and store your favorite articles in favorite section. There is also more about the application but you can check those if you clone the app repository.

Application got rate limit per API so you can request only 10 requests per minute. And for that I put some delay of 6 sec.

The resason why I choose New York Times API instead of News API is because News API had last update on February 15, 2016.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
